<!--
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

            <p>My name is Jeremiah Taylor and I am new to software development. I am striving to be the best that I can be while learning all that I can. I hope to make connections that will benifit myself as well as others!</p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>I started my coding journey a few months ago after talking with a friend. He was about 2 years into his journey and told me about the rewarding career path he was on. Right away I was interested. My hope is that in 5 - 10 years I can help others progress and follow their dreams of becoming software developers. Someday I plan to have my own freelancing business and help those who cannot afford web development.</p>
